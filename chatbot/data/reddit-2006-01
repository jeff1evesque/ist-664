The fact that Graham is interested in painting(not entirely untalented as well), and knows something of its history (maybe not everything) certainly gives him enough authority to say 'hey, these things are not so different.' I have no problem believing that there is overlap between Paul Graham's painting-mode and Paul Graham's hacking-mode, and am glad for the insights he offers regarding the creative process in general.\r\n\r\nIt can be a bit annoying when people from the 'hard' sciences start talking about the Art of their practice. In my experience, this usually results from a confusion between beauty/elegance and Art at large. The last 150 years have served as a pretty strong argument that beauty != Art, and its no wonder that some people would find it difficult to consider merge-sort (or even viaweb) in the same light as Guernica.\r\n\r\nHowever, by the same token, artists have a habit of intentionally mysticizing their work.

It does *not* mean universities are crap at teaching.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in his essay, JS keeps complaining about crappy recruiters \"who use grep to evaluate r\u00c3\u00a9sum\u00c3\u00a9s\" and hire crappy programmers as a result. This one really bothers me, for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. If hiring crappy programmers is as simple as using grep, then why doesn't Joel just use grep *himself* to sort them out? \r\n\r\n2. Hiring brilliant programmers *must* be hard. Orelse everyone will be able to hire them and Joel will lose his competitive advantage.\r\n\r\nI really think Joel is becoming a bit crotchety (as he himself admits).\r\n\r\nI remember how back in the 90's everyone complained about how the universities treat CS as abstract *science* and do not teach you jack about actual *programming*, i.e. working for a real company in the real world.\r\n\r\nNow, as universities start teaching people the stuff they'll most probably need to actually pay they bills, now that they start (or continue?) teaching programming languages that are actually used in the industry, now those *very same* people start telling us how much better the old days were.\r\n\r\nC'mon, face it, the need for Scheme applications is not exactly rising.\r\n\r\nSure, I get your point, learning Scheme or Lisp or SML will make you a better programmer in any language, including Java. \r\n\r\nBut that's like saying that studying physics will make you a better driver. It surely will, but most pizza-delivering companies simply don't require their drivers to hold a Ph.D. in physics, so *why waste your time* studying physics if you could get the job anyway?\r\n\r\nTellya what, understanding the Theory of Relativity will make you an *even better* programmer. But does that mean that anyone who doesn't understand the Theory of Relativity is a crappy programmer?\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with Joel, however, is his whining about \r\n\r\n&gt; CS graduates who are simply not smart enough to work \r\n&gt; as programmers on anything more sophisticated than \r\n&gt; Yet Another Java Accounting Application\r\n\r\nSorry, Joel, but such arrogance makes me sick. Last time I checked, you were working on nothing more sophisticated than Yet Another ASP Bugtracking Application. Frankly, you are not in a position to dis anyone.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that your bugtracking software is the cat's whiskers, and you certainly need brilliant people to make it work for left-handed avocado farmers with Polish keyboards -- but again, writing accounting software that works for left-handed avocado farmers with Polish keyboards is *just* as hard and requires *just* as brilliant programmers.\r\n\r\nAnd again, if hiring brilliant people becomes easy, then you'll have to *compete* against those grep-using recruiters.

The result being is that you get some sort of half-baked position that's neither here nor there, often without some of the benefits like the month of vacation.\r\n\r\nSomething else that's interesting that these stats dont' really show is that a large portion of Italy takes their vacations in the same month - August - when much of northern Italy shuts down.

I refused to have a blind faith - Christ said to love God \"with all your mind, heart and body\". Obviously that implies more than just a blind emotional faith. That being said, I've yet to find anyone who can find a true inconstency with the Bible. Every \"inconsistentcy\" or \"contradiction\" I've ever seen brought forth against the Bible is either a) not reading the text in context or b) not understanding the audience it was written to. I'd love it if you would show me one.\r\n\r\n&gt; If historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth, it must be that a religious belief comes from faith alone.\r\n\r\nAnd the Bible has shown time and time again that it is an accurate historical record. An example: Sir William Ramsay was a respected archaelogist who lived at the end of the 19th century. He was an atheist who ascribed to the theory that the Book of Acts was a product of made up stories produced in the 3rd century. Using the Bible as source text, he set out around the Mediterranean intend on disproving it.  In the process of trying to show that the Biblical stories were made up, he found that the Bible was a remarkably accurate historical text. He suprised everyone when he returned home and wrote his book *St. Paul the Traveller and Roman Citizen* in which he stated, \"Great historians are the rarest of writers...[I regard Luke] among the historians of the first rank\".\r\n\r\n&gt; Since we are free to believe in whatever we choose, why not believe in ourselves?\r\n\r\nDid Hitler not believe in himself? Did Jeffrey Dahmer not believe in himself? If we have no ultimate authority on what is right or wrong, what business do you have telling the murderer that he is doing wrong? Perhaps he is only doing what he believes right (see Hitler).\r\n\r\nI think there is a bit of misunderstanding on what exactly faith is. Faith doesn't necessarily imply one without evidence. You place faith/trust in your friends or certain people because they have shown you that they are reliable. Faith is placed on court decisions not because there is absolute proof that something has happened, but rather because the evidence is too great to ignore. The same goes for the Christian. You don't have to put blinders on to believe in God. Infact, God wants you to seek him out and look for the evidence that he is there. It is the only reason I am a Christian - I have seen historically and in my own life time and time again evidences of God.\r\n\r\nJust like many of you were not born atheists or raised as an atheist, I was not born a Christian.","subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_22936","stickied":false}

The KJV was based off of manuscripts from the 10th century AD and later, where as modern translations come from texts dating as far back as the 3rd and 4th centuries. Understanding of ancient Biblical Hebrew and Greek has also obviously increased since 1600 (when the KJV was written) as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the verses they cite, Deuteronomy 4:40, in the KJV reads, \"That thou mayest prolong **thy days upon the earth**, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever.\". Where as in the NIV it reads, \"Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may **live long in the land** the LORD your God gives you for all time.\" Now obviously these people aren't going to live forever and thus be able to live in the land forever, but it is a symbolic representation of God's covenant with Israel.\r\n\r\nDeuteronomy 4:40 is not referring to the earth as a planet, but rather as the land the Israelites knew. This rendering also fits in the context of the verse, where Moses is speaking to the Israelites about their future in the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\nAnyway, their first example is an excellent example of not looking at the verses in context with the rest of the Bible. Yes, the current earth will be destroyed, but verses such as Isaiah 56 speak of \"a new heavens and a new earth\" (actually, they reference this one). So while the current version of the earth will not always be around, earth itself will, and that's what the verses provided are getting at.\r\n\r\nAnother example they provide, which is \"is dancing a sin\" is a great example of taking the verses out of context. For example, they reference Exodus 32, which says, \"And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot.... And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?\"\r\n\r\nThey actually italicize dancing as if it is the sin of the Israelites, but in the context of the entire passage, that is obviously not the case. The act of dancing wasn't sinful, it was the act of worshipping the golden calf which was sinful. I'm actually very suprised they even tried to call this an inconsistency because its *really* stretching it to call it one. The same goes with the other verses they referenced to try and show that the Bible says dancing is sin.\r\n\r\nI could keep going with these examples, but I think I have provided enough to show some of the major problems with these so-called \"inconsistencies\". One thing that should be known about Ecclesiastes is it by nature is a very contradictory book. Solomon (the author) praises different actions and desires and in the very next sentence will speak of how worthless they are. Basically alluding to the fact on how great things are at first but how they quickly lose their luster. That's why by the end of the book, you see him make a succinct summary, \"Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\"\r\n\r\nBut again, most of these alleged contradictions would not even be pointed out if critics would take the time to read many of the passages in context instead of isolating sentences and trying to make them read what they aren't. I mean, The Bible actually says, \"there is no God\"...but if you read the entire verse in context, it reads, \"The fool says there is no God\". Obviously you can see the problem with chosing one verse out of a collection of 66 books and trying to interpret the verse just by itself.","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1136287483,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

I wonder where you get the idea that its \"only available to the radibly fanatical\". Denouncing could be anything from \"his works are incorrect\" to \"he's burning in hell\". I mean, really...it could go from one extreme to another.\r\n\r\nI quick look-up on the literal definition (not that it really matters):\r\n\r\n1.  To condemn openly as being evil or reprehensible. See Synonyms at criticize.\r\n2. To accuse formally.\r\n3. To give formal announcement of the ending of (a treaty).\r\n\r\nRobbie, aren't you \"comdemning openly\" those who are \"rabidly fanatical\"? Should we take you to court for that? Oddly enough, in doing the same thing you are condemning...are you now a \"radidly fanatical\" person also?\r\n\r\nI do not literally mean what I just said, but your snap judgement on the situation when the article isn't very specific is a little off. The whole trial seems more than a little bizarre. A priest denounces (this could mean a myriad of things) a man who is denouncing the person of Jesus Christ, so now the man takes the priest to court and is sueing him? And on top of that the judge wants the priest to prove Jesus Christ exists? Like I said, the whole thing sounds ridiculous and bizarre. And for the record, I'm not a Roman Catholic if anyone feels like trying to use that against me.\r\n","controversiality":1}

Very easy proof of that being false is that Christ is mentioned in the Talmud. The fact that Christ was mentioned in other nonBiblical sources really is not debatable.\r\n\r\nThe Bible has shown time and time again to be an accurate account of history. People debated that the Hittites ever existed (they were mentioned in the Bible). Lo and behold, their civilization was discovered around the end of the 19th century. People debated if Pilate ever existed...a cornerstone that says, \"Potius Pilate, procurator of the Jews\" has been found in ancient Caeseara Phillippi. As I stated in another post, Sir William Ramsay was an atheist who set out using the Book of Acts as his guidebook at disprove it and show that it was a product of 3rd century myths. He began excavating in the Mediterranean and suprised everyone when he came back and made the comment in his book, \"I consider Luke a historian of the first rank\".\r\n\r\nIf Christ did not exist, the Jewish rabbis (they had more reason that anyone to say that he didn't exist) would not have mentioned them in the Talmud. Instead of denying that he existed, they attribute his actions to being a bastard child, being a sorceror, etc. Josephus mentions Christ (altough the lengths to which he does are albeit debatable). Tacitus, a Roman historian, mentions Christ.\r\n\r\nBy 64 AD, Nero was already blaming things on a new religious group, the Christians, which implies that the religion necessarily began earlier. John and other writers claimed to be first-hand witnesses of Christ, and then went out and preached this gospel for absolutely no gain and were stoned, crucified, and mocked for this gospel. If you know for a fact that something is a lie...how often is it that a man is willing to die for that lie?\r\n\r\nI could mention many evidences, but the simple truth is...if Christ did not exist a tall, the Jewish rabbis (who again, would love to deny that he existed anyway), would not have bothered writing about him in the Talmud. Why would you make negative statements about a man who never existed?\r\n\r\nSo again, if Christ was indeed just a misidentified person, then not only did the Christians do the misidentifying, but the leading Jewish religious leaders did as well. And I can assure you, the Jews would not be confusing their heretics.\r\n\r\nAnd John of Gamala? A quick Google on his name reveals a bunch of fiction books with him as a leader character. There are no scholarly sources that mention him. If anything, it would seem that he was the one who did not exist.\r\n\r\nSomething else I wanted to add: for the disciples to completely fabricate the story of Jesus makes absolutely no sense at all. They added detailst that would have severly restricted the popularity of the religion. For example...the Gospel accounts attribute divinity to Jesus, a man. This was completely contrary to the Jewish idea of God as an invisible all-powerful force. Infact, the Jews were so opposed to setting limits to God, that they wouldn't even write his name. For the disciples to fabricate the story of Christ as actually being God would have been pretty much a suicidal way to start their religion in the eyes of the Jews. In addition, Christ would not have been a popular God in the eyes of the Romans who did not have a positive view of the Jews and who had powerful gods such as Jupiter. This story of a Jewish god dying on the cross, embarassing himself by being naked and defecating on himself would not have been attractive to any Romans. And something that would not have been attractive to either Roman or Jew was the account by each Gospel that the first person to reach Christ's grave and to discover he was missing was a woman. This would be seen as making a woman a witness (ie, highly accountable) and was not something that happened in either society. There are many more examples of things like these, but in short, Christianity is the exact opposite of the type of religion you just make up. There are so many unnecessary and seemingly negative details in the Gospel accounts that its just laughable to suppose that the man of Jesus was a myth. It spread in spite of itself, not because of itself.\r\n\r\nAgain, you can debate the divinity of Christ all day, but to act like he didn't even exist is just ludicrous.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_23021","subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

Linear systems are proportional (if the input is changed the output changes by a proportional ammount) and additive (the output in response to the sum of two inputs is exactly the sum of the outputs in response to the inputs individually). Ojects moving in a gravitational field do not meet these requirements even if you ignore friction. Dip into high-school physics, pull out the basic equations for kinetic and potential energy, and consider the relationship between initial velocity and height reached by the cannonball. If you can't see the non-linearity there perhaps you should go buy one of Crichton's books...\r\n\r\nEnough beating a dead horse.\r\n\r\nWhat he is really talking about seems to be non-deterministic systems, which aren't as unpredictable as he wants. If it weren't possible to predict to some degree of accuracy the behavior of non-deterministic systems we could achieve nothing.\r\n\r\nHe seems to demand total predictability which is a real jack-a$$ thing to do, right along the lines of the creationists (ID'ers). He contends that complex systems can only be managed. Management requires some ability to expect a result from a cetain action, which is prediction. So by his argument, since complex systems can't be predicted, and management requires prediction, management of complex systems is impossible. Does he even think this stuff through? Although to be fair, his idea of management and predictions are probably different.\r\n\r\nHe also seems to be engaging in some intellectual dishonesty by showing the headline and first few words of the Independent's \"Future of the Earth\" article and implying that the article is an example of people playing on fear. From the way it starts I wager that the article is actually along the lines of his argument, not an actual fear-mongering piece. I can't verify since the Independent wants a Pound to purchase the article...\r\n\r\nAnother thing, doctors, especially MD's are not scientists automaticaly. They are technicians who apply the findings of science. Some doctors are scientists, they do research. The rest are like mechanics, they try to figure out a problem and fix it (at a gross level), not experiment to find explanations for the problem. Oversimplifying here: there is some cross-over between general practice medicine and the practice of science, the same can be said of mechanics. However, having an MD, PhD, or an ASE certification doesn't mean you know crap about an unrelated field.\r\n\r\nI could go on all night.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_23089","subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

It states:\r\n\r\n1. What is the Corruption Perceptions Index?\r\nThe TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is\r\nperceived to exist among public officials and politicians. It is a composite index, drawing on corruptionrelated\r\ndata in expert surveys carried out by a variety of reputable institutions. It reflects the views of\r\nbusiness people and analysts from around the world, including experts who are locals in the countries\r\nevaluated.\r\n\r\nOn the site I linked to, they already describe in detail how difficult it is to gather information on corruption under question 5:\r\n\r\n5. Can the costs of corruption be quantified?\r\nThe short answer is \"no\". Some experts use regression analyses and other empirical methods in order to try to put a dollar figure on the cost of corruption. It is virtually impossible, though, since payments of bribes are not publicly recorded. No one knows exactly how much money is being \"invested\" in corrupt officials annually. And bribes do not take only monetary form: favours, services, presents and so on are just as common. At most, one can research the correlation between the level of corruption and, say, democratisation, economic development or environmental degradation.The social costs of corruption are even less quantifiable. No one knows how much the loss of an energetic entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs a country. Moreover, any estimated social costs in dollars would be inadequate to the task of measuring the human tragedy behind resignation, illiteracy, or inadequate medical care. A general scepticism vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis any attempt at quantifying the costs of corruption is thus warranted.The following example illustrates the dilemma of pressing the issue into facts and figures:\r\nA power plant is being built somewhere in the world, at a cost of US$ 100 million. It could be argued that - were it not for corruption - the cost could have been as low as US$ 80 million. The financial damage to the public would then be US$ 20 million. In practice, quite often projects are planned simply so that those involved can make huge private profits. Assuming that the power plant was superfluous, the financial damage would have to be assessed at US$ 100 million. Yet no major construction project leaves the environment untouched. The results may be: increased pollution, a lowering of land prices, resettlement of local residents, an increased debt burden for the country, etc. This calculation - probably closest to reality - is immensely complex. On a global scale, it seems almost impossible. But even if one were able to calculate the environmental damage, the increase of the debt burden and other factors, how would one measure the erosion of public confidence and the deterioration of a government's legitimacy, which are the direct result of corruption?\r\n\r\nIn my perception, you've taken a defensive stance against this data since it triggered your bogometer. However, the site I linked to fully described the potential for bogus data and stresses the difficulty you're concerned about. Whether the actual list is useful or not, it certainly got me to read their site to see how they came up with the data and now I find myself understanding corruption a bit more. That's kinda useful to me.","controversiality":0,"score":0,"ups":0,"created_utc":1136450790,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"Didn't the dot com bubble last something like 4 years? (from '96 to '00)  So saying you predicted it but you were just 3 years early means you would've missed most of the boom (had you acted accordingly).\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think that housing prices are due for a correction.  I can only see two beneficiaries of the current housing 'boom' : real estate agents, mortage brokers and local governments that base property taxes on a percentage of property value.  So what if my house has gone up in value by 50% in the last four years?  If I sold my house I'd still need someplace to live, so either: 1) I'd have to buy another house (which has also gone up at least by the same percentage meaning that I really can't capture the gain) or 2) I'd have to rent and because housing prices have gone up, so have rents (landlords need to cover those mortage payments). The article claims that rents haven't gone up, but certainly they have in some areas pricing low income people out of the rental market.  In areas where rents haven't gone up it might make sense to go for option 2 (sell and rent until the bubble pops) because you could perhaps capture some of the gain.\r\n\r\nSo what real benefit have I gotten as a homeowner by rising real estate prices?  I pay more in property taxes now and other people around me who rent are paying more in rent (meaning they have less money to spend on other things).  It's the Real Estate agents who have played a big role in talking up this market.  Bring on the correction, lower prices will be good for those who don't yet own homes and they won't hurt those of us who have been in our homes for several years (it's going to hurt for those who have bought in the last couple of years, though; they'll have to consider it an expensive lesson in buying high and selling low).","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_23786","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":5,"ups":5,"created_utc":1136514204,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"rubyfan","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c3514","parent_id":"t3_23786","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473822158}

Among others, it goes against christian dogma, but eh, a couple of fine chaps like Galileo did, so I'm not ashamed to be in such a company.\r\n\r\nI don't know her, and I'm projecting some of my personnal views on her: that's exactly the purpose of her mediatization. \r\n\r\nMaybe she's disgusted with life, maybe she spends her lifetime dreaming she was dead on that day, maybe she feels definitely lost for sane social interaction, for bearing and rising kids, surely her life is a permanent physical suffering, probably does she rightly bet that this suffering will only end with her death. Maybe she sees little purpose in her surviving, and has little hope to find such a purpose in the future.\r\n\r\nOr maybe she thinks that what she endures is God's will, that it has an Inneffable meaning, that demonstrating her outstanding courage is of crucial importance, maybe she loves her medicalised life, with it's suffering, horrors, etc. just as Job did on his manure heap. \r\n\r\nI have as little (or as much) ground to claim the former as you have to claim the latter. I certainly wouldn't hold the same speach, had she personnaly taken part in the discussion, but here she's only a substrate, on which we grow a discussion or more general interest, so we don't have to care too much about betraying her philosophical stand, had she one. \r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly disagree with your claim that \"She has endured horrific pain and agony in order to LIVE\". I've been living with an intensive care doctor, and I've got no illusion about who fights for survival: doctors do whatever it takes to keep people technically alive, with little to no consideration for the kind of life it might be. They give no opportunity to the patient to choose between life and death.  I would add that many doctors do it as a _Wille zur Macht_ move (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche), which is awfully ungodly if you look at it from a religious standpoint, and cursed such prominent figures as Moses.\r\n\r\nBottom line is: if you didn't make a conscious choice, then there is no courage involved. Nothing indicates that she ever had an opportunity to make a choice, and my experience with physicians makes me strongly believe that she never had one.\r\n\r\nA bit of philosophy/theology to finish. You write: \"She is a human being and a courageous survivor. To me, that is beautiful\". I've already written what I think of this courage. About her being a survivor, what does it mean? The end of her life is indeed slightly delayed (she's going to suffer skin cancers, immunodepressions, general bad health due to lack of physical activity, various other organic dysfunctions, and probably a lack of reasons to enjoy life, so don't expect her to live very old). I would find it beautiful if these years were put to use into something that surpasses her personnal life. Merely staying alive isn't exactly such a sublime thing, my dog would do the same. Your life's only worth what you make of it. \r\n\r\nI really don't buy the \"this is a beautiful proof of courage\" thing: that's mumbo-jumbo repeated by religious people to cover how difficult it is to see God's will, in a world which has always seemed unfair, and where now humanity's power grows at such insane speed that most of theological views become obsolete instantaneous (a couple of decades _is_ instantaneous, for theology). What was God's will: the crash? Her survival? The conditions of this survival? Doctors being able and willing to maintains her alive? Why would this very high-tech, artificial, survival medical effort be godly, whereas, say, articifial fecundation or contraception would be ungodly? Can I remind you that until no-so-long ago, opening corpses to improve medical knowledge and power was considered as terribly ungodly, and would grant you death by burning? The whole standpoint of ethics (including religion) about survival has been blown by the pace of medical progress. It will take decades before we adapt our ethics to these new conditions. That won't be too much of a heartbreak for secular ethics; OTOH religious views which pretend to be eternal will suffer much more from that twist...\r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_23600","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1136546029,"author_flair_css_class":null}

What is needed is similar applications with tighter access controls set by the maker of the profile.\r\n\r\nIts understandable that since the entire business models of these sites relies on them having as much info as possible about you for targeted advertising, these sites provide possibly the **most accurate** and **easiest to use** resource for mining information about groups of people.\r\n\r\nFears of some NSA/ government conspiracies aside, the potential for abuse of these systems has already been proven. Private schools have gone apeshit in in the last year doing things like registering on facebook and looking for anything, even simply thoughts or jokes that could be interpreted as violating school policy. This is a huge problem. I would be surprised if government agencies don't start using this information to screen new hires.\r\n\r\nIn the short term I would suggest that you DONT use your real name to register for sites like facebook.. since they are nice enough to not let you change it after. From experience I'll let you know that otherwise you'll have to use it knowing that everything you write, your pictures, groups, and friends can and will be monitored by your school.. and possibly others.\r\n\r\nAn example, recently some friends of mine were nearly suspended just for being in a group that mentioned drinking on campus. I can here some of you now whining that that's no big deal, but just think of how much this could cost the students. A year of tuition, hundreds of hours of community service (which is as expensive as overtime given that he is already busy), new living expenses, etc. The potential of private schools to censor and penalize students for communication that is intended to be PRIVATE amoung themselves is rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nNow you would expect that since fb has a number of privacy measures (mostly through limiting visibility of profiles), it would be a much more creative and relaxed environment. Well it isn't, and it's boring as heck unless your writing cute little love letters to all your friends. It's gotten much worse lately as many have realized that whatever they write, the wrong people will find out about it. This is a direct failure of the privacy mechanisms that the site setup to, i think, lessen this fear.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the other side of the spectrum, myspace, were your name is whatever you want, everyone writes all about their drunken sex parties, and even slip porn in now and then, you'll see something closer to the creative and fun place that the net could provide. Not to mention that everyone doesn't seem so scared. Too bad the site is focused on 10yo girls..\r\n\r\nSo, why am I complaining so much and what can be done about it? My idea, which I have roughly implemented, is as follows.  Basically my solution is to create a trust based authentication system. For example in a system similar to these sites, the visibility of Bob's profile could be degraded based on the amount that Bob and/or Bob's friends trusts the viewer, Alice. For the most part everything would be transparent except that Bob would now be able to rate his friends in different categories such as trustworthiness and then optionally tune these ranking thresholds to correspond to levels of visibility. Of course the challenge of this is making it totally distributed and backed by crypto to ensure that the rules are followed regardless of subpoenas.. which my implementation demonstrates. I've drafted up a few papers, and have plenty of implementation code if anyone wants to take a look.\r\n\r\nSo what does everyone else think? Anyone with better ideas? Or maybe your all happy living in a glass house.. I'm sure that anyone that has done extensive non-business communication online has been bitten when the wrong person read things you wrote that weren't intended for her. \r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n----\r\nIs there any reason that these comment boxes are so tiny? ;)\r\n-- Oh and when is reddit::blogs going live??\r\n","controversiality":1,"created_utc":1136557977,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":0,"ups":0,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

Unless something is an absolute fact, we should include the most commonly held views as those that should be taught, making sure to mention that there are other points of view that are different.\r\n\r\nAs such, I believe there should be at least one other option mentioned when it comes to \"how we got here.\"  Obviously, whether you believe it or not (I don't), the Theory of Evolution deserves to have the lion's share of time devoted to it.  However, there should be mention that there are other points of view.  I'm surprised that, since there are so many people in this country who claim to believe in God, there wouldn't be more than a passing interest in the concept of ID.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk about the separation of church and state, we usually think about it meaning that the church is not to be the state.  We definitely bend over backwards to make sure of that-- just look at all the Christmas/Channukah/\"holiday\" debates we just came out of a week ago.  However, we also should look at the other side of the coin there-- the state is not to be the church.  And when you talk about the origin of the world, you are engaging in both scientific and religious terms.\r\n\r\nMany people would love to be able to send their children to a religious school.  However, those who want to do so face a major handicap:  they must pay for their child's education while the tax money they have contributed goes to a public school.  I don't want to turn this into a voucher debate (one controversial topic at a time, please!), but this problem does make it more difficult for \"regular\" people to send their kids to a religious school than to a public one.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just my $0.02."}

{"stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_23938","subreddit_id":"t5_6","body":"The article's author comments on being a wage slave with his youthful experience of 26 years, and it shows.  Let's quickly visit some \"nuggets\" of wisdom:\r\n\r\n\"Common programmers may expect to earn at least $60,000/year, but it is rare for even superstar programmers to command above $150,000, excepting very specialized markets like kernel driver development.\"\r\n\r\nThe 60k to 150k range for an annual salary is characteristic of a career to which the property \"slave\" is attached?  Interesting.\r\n\r\n\"But in taking the full risk and reward of the enterprise upon himself, the programmer who is not sorely wanting in skills of business development or marketing must soon find himself enjoying the fruits of his labors, albeit many times only after years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor.\"\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing to find that this is held as some sort of dreamlike gold standard.  Mr. Weekly apparently has failed to consider the depth to which \"years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor\" might cause many individuals to be satisfied with their 60k-150k salaries.  Some of them might even have responsibilities such as student loan payments, mortgages, or families to take care of.\r\n\r\nOh, what the hell.  Quit your job anyway.  Duties be damned, there's a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow!\r\n\r\n\"Wages and debt go hand in hand, for creditors only make loans which can be repaid regularly. Therefore, the single most important question they ask when ascertaining credit is one's present wages.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Weekly is quite unfamiliar with the FICO credit score, which has NO direct reference to one's income. Bankers do care about income, but they care far more about your fidelity to their debts. The theory goes: If you've reliably met your financial obligations in the past, you'll probably meet them again in the future, regardless of income.\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty good theory.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAs far as the actual heart of the article goes, Mr. Weekly seriously devalues and brushes aside the invaluable work performed by the rest of a company to which a programmer gives his allegiance.  I think many project managers, executive officers, salesmen, and marketers would object to the fact that a mere sprinkling of their skills is all that is necessary to turn a decent piece of software into what the author implies is a near unlimited, wage-free source of wealth.\r\n\r\nBut at least he encourages the reader to avoid wanton debt.

I'm now a downright grizzly old man of 27. I'm pretty amused by how quickly some people latched onto my age and decided to brush aside anything I had to say as a result, because I clearly (in their eyes) couldn't have possibly lived long enough to be able to bring insight into the labor market without a few decades of work experience.\r\n\r\nI realize that plenty of people are risk averse and recognize the comforts that a $60k+ / year job provide. Those people can live a reasonable lifestyle, enjoy their jobs, and find life content. The economy is largely composed of such people and absolutely requires these people.\r\n\r\nBut there are some people who have it in them to go it on their own, and they owe it to themselves (and society) to make a try at it. These people are a little less risk-averse, are interested in developing a broader skillset, etc. Some of this is luck (to not be covered in crushing debt) and some of this is chutzpah (or hubris, as you please).\r\n\r\nAs for my brushing aside of the value of the other players in the company - I think it's a reaction to the fact that executive management and salespeople already effectively operate on commission. If the company does well, they do well. But the same is not generally true of the engineering staff. And only engineers capable of acting in a founder-style role and having ownership over their ideas will be able to see the sorts of returns that executives and salespeople are regularly able to achieve.\r\n\r\nAnd if enough engineers leave to start their own ventures, management at larger companies may consider giving engineers a larger ownership of the company as retention strategy. Until there is market pressure to do so, however, we're unlikely to see significant ownership on the part of the engineers and innovators who are creating a company's core property.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_23938","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1136575813,"score":6,"ups":6}

But what this guy leaves out is a crucial fact: how to get served this short size coffee. Starbucks staff are told: if someone asks for a \"small\" - serve a tall (that's a 12oz cup); if someone asks for \"medium\" serve a tall. Whatever they ask for, serve a tall. The only way you can get a short (8oz) size is to specifically ask for a \"short\" - whether cappuchino, mocha, latte, whatever. Sometimes the staff will deny there is any such size, but that's because they are stupid. Usually there is no hassle. Sometimes they will claim that they don't have the right size cups - in which case point them over to the children's milk size cups (which is the only place an 8oz appears on a standard Starbucks menu) and say: \"That one\".\r\n\r\nI don't do it to be a pain in the butt - I just don't want to drink so much liquid.

But it seems to me that the reason Haskell is unpopular is that it just isn't the kind of language that's fated to be popular right now.  (disclosure: I'm a Lisp guy, so I'm only partly qualified for this)\r\n\r\nBut I think that at least part of the reason for Haskell and Lisp's unpopularity is that they don't go out of their way to provide stuff that the so-called \"average programmer\" takes for granted -- like easy I/O and infix notation.  Haskell's and Lisp's respective communities have their reasons, which are perfectly legitimate, but they (at least, a lot of Lispers and the author of this post) haven't come to terms with the fact that if 'unconventional' or 'revolutionary' or 'unique'  are part of what your language *is*, it's not likely to be embraced by the mainstream quickly.  Changing people's minds takes time, and \"trying harder\" to make that happen is like trying harder to strike a match on a wet cake of soap.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, none of this is meant to suggest that standardizing on a single distribution and whatnot aren't a good idea -- that would make Lisp a lot nicer too."}

AFAIK, where Lisp macros are used, they are not usually *essential*, just a way to cut down complexity and redundancy, and that's what I'm targetting here. I would have to see an example to try to create a real equivalent.\r\n\r\nJavascript has object literals and a builtin for...in operation, which are the equivalent of a dictionary or association list elsewhere. I use a simple function for creating HTML (through the W3C DOM interface) that takes an object with (some of) the properties 'tag', 'attributes', 'children', etc. and creates  DOM nodes based on it. The resulting code is about 5% of the size and complexity of equivalent code that uses the DOM functions directly. (For this reason, I object heavily to modifying the object prototype object, since each added function will show up in a for..in operation.)\r\n\r\nAnother tool is doing wacky things with object prototypes and binding functions to objects. Setting aside the OO vs. functional debate, this is very handy at times. \r\n\r\nAlso, in any function, the arguments are available as the array 'arguments', which can be used creatively, though not always constructively.\r\n\r\nI *would* like to see a Lisp-like system where you can make macros by messing with the parse tree, but even that would not be nearly as useful as Lips macros.

But the comment system on Reddit is excellent - for one it has threaded discussions and does them very well, the formatting tools are very easy to use, and I love how voting a comment up or down is no different than voting a link up and down. That just makes sense, and its intuitive.\r\n\r\nI also think that Reddit's system of just having a descriptive title instead of a title and a description is very wise. You can see many more stories. If you see a title that looks interesting, you actually look at the link. On Digg most of the time the title is worthless and all the thought it put into the description, or vice versa. Its just redundant. And then on Digg you have the problem of people only reading the description and digging it based on that.\r\n\r\nAnd Reddit is just clean. I wish I had come up with the layout myself. Its just very simple and it gets things done. For that I think spez and kn0thing are genius (well, the whole site is genius), but Reddit really does have that same simplicity that made Google the bomb.\r\n\r\nAlso...its got the mascot. That's all I need to say about him. \r\n\r\nRight now it just seems like you got Digg and Slashdot slugging it out and Reddit is kind of the odd man out that no one really notices. But maybe that is a good thing, because right now the community is very good.\r\n\r\nYou, for example, enjahova, I've already spoken with you in several link discussions, and though we disagreed on a few things, I think it was done respectfully. With the massive amount of people who use both Digg and Slashdot, its much harder to recognize people, and you don't get the same respect while discussing.\r\n\r\nOne of the few things that irks me about Reddit is how some things are voted down just because of a mindset someone has. A link or a comment can be constructive and well-though out and can even be right, but just because people don't agree with that viewpoint they vote it down. That doesn't seem to be much of a problem right now (I have noticed it a few times), but it might become a bigger problem as the site grows.","link_id":"t3_24753","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1136829604,"score":14,"ups":14}

So you can write a nonrecursive function (note that fact-nr is not recursive.), and then pass that nonrecursive function to U, which will make it a traditional recursive factorial, just like we have all written the first time we try out a  new lisp.\r\n\r\nBut why do all this?  If this were all there is to combinators, no one would use them.  But combinators can be used to fundamentally change the way function calls work in your language.  For instance, memoization can be an interesting technique-you can memorize the value of a function call, and then just return that when you get the same call again.  If your language supports combinators, you can hack in memoization yourself.  This is very cool.  I will try to write an essay about this, in my copious spare time.\r\n","score":3,"ups":3,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1136855468,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

These seem to be relatively common, and typically provide something on the order of $1,500 to $2,000 for work on research projects under a faculty member. Not much money, but it is a start. This can be supplemented by additional grant money if it can be found (a well connected faculty member can help).\r\n\r\nIt might be possible for your department to create a short term job position for you if it has the funds available. This is a big 'if' and depends on a lot of factors ('extra' department cash, compliant faculty member, compelling project).\r\n\r\nFor student projects, it will be easier to find funding if you are working on something that qualifies as a research problem. Try to show potential funders that your idea is worth sinking a couple grand into. If you're thinking of some kind of message board 'Web 2.0' buzzword crap, you will have problems. Not that this junk isn't interesting but: much has already been done by people with more resources and experience, it's not really that innovative from a CS perspective (ooh, 'tagging'), and as a result the educational advantages would be slim.\r\n\r\nI've focused on academic funding sources since much of the commercial world has problems understanding OSS. Since OSS scares many of the 'intellectual property' trolls, they will not be too inclined to risk cash for what they perceive as no return.\r\n\r\nIn any case, it would be helpful to develop a working relationship with a faculty member with related interests. This will bring you drastically more benefit than trying to whore yourself out to business. Working with faculty can also make for references when it is time to whore yourself out to business, or graduate shcools...\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n* Define your project as a **research** problem.\r\n* Find a faculty mentor.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."}

And in that context (most) religious people have two metabeliefs, one saying that the scientific method is *one* way of obtaining facts, and another saying that the bible (ku'ran/talmud etc) is also a source for facts, along with historical and modern interpretaions of their specific religious tradition.\r\n\r\nI would claim that religous people are delusional because I think that the *facts* they believe are not true facts, but that is not a philisophicaly sound position because it comes down to the fact that I don't agree with one of their metabeliefs, which is subjective.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we are to demand simplicity then holding two metabeliefs when one suffices is clearly excessive.

Now perhaps the authors of reason.org mean \"conserved\" in that the sense that the designer gave different species some similar stretches of DNA, except with minor changes that make it only appear to look like it was a product of evolution, rather than design.

The selection half is quite non-random, and which eventually selects the variations that provide the slightest of advantages.  \r\n\r\nHowever, do you see that the standard creationist description of the creation of man precisely what you deride?

{"body":"The basis for Christianity is not belief that the Bible is as an inerrant source of truth. The basis for intelligent Christian thought is the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, as recorded in the gospels, which form a historical (rather than mystical) basis. I do not appreciate those who represent Christianity as an arbitrary blind belief, either by those who believe it or those who do not. (The Answers In Genesis organization comes to mind. I've attended part of one of their mind-numbing weekend programs.)\r\n\r\nSecond, it is correct that those who promote scientific discovery should do so at the expense of certain untenable ideas within religious systems. It is not necessary to dismiss or contradict the progress of science in order to have some belief in the supernatural; neither is it necessary to ridicule all religion in order to promote science. I think those who do should be told to stick to science and avoid public discourse. Science, like religion, should expose itself by confidence in facts, not through spectacular displays of irrelevant criticism.\r\n\r\nThird, there is misunderstanding behind the atheistic view of the origin of life, which is that science has completely explained the origin of life. This is not true. Scientists have yet to discover mechanisms for the appearance of life that are satisfactory science, rather than speculation.

He also seems very double-minded. There is a story in the Hadith about how Muhammad was tricked by Satan and had to have someone else call him out on it and then he made the right ruling. If Muhammad was tricked by Satan once, how do you know he wasn't tricked the entire time?\r\n\r\nJoeseph Smith was even worse. This is a man who destroyed a printing press because they said negative things about him. This is a man who said that the American government would be destroyed by the wrath of God (still standing, btw). This is a man who married many many women, including women that already were married. He, like Muhammad, became extremely wealthy.\r\n\r\nJoseph Smith had \"prophecy\" after \"prophecy\" that ended up being completely false. Several of the original men who swore that they saw the golden tablets the Book of Mormon was translated on later ended up recanting their story. \r\n\r\nNot only that, but the Book of Mormon has absolutely no historical or archaelogical backing. This is not the case at all with the Bible.\r\n\r\nActually, the stories of Muhammad and Joseph Smith are eerily similar when you do some study on the two.\r\n\r\nBut the I look at Christ's actions. He never gained anything by what he preached. He didn't become weathly. He didn't marry many women. He didn't try to overthrow the government or start wars. He, much like the Bible says, \"was led like a lamb to the slaughter\".\r\n\r\nI also see many OT prophecies concerning Christ that are very specific and fit his character exactly. For example, \r\n\r\n\"And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit [a] of grace and supplication. They will look on [b] me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him...\" - Zechariah 12:9-11\r\n\r\nKeep in mind, this is written at least 400 years before Christ, and is written by a Jew in a society that was so scared of idolatry that they wouldn't even say his name, much less ascribe to him any kind of a physical form. Yet this piercing of God very much fits the image of Christ.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to make a long story short, Christ practiced what he preached, \"To love the Lord your God with all your heart and to love your neigbhor as yourself\". He didn't have anything to gain. Infact, he gave everything for his message. Muhammad and JS gained many worldy pleasures for what they did.\r\n\r\nI also think that something that isolates Christianity from other religions is it is the only religion that teaches salvation by faith as opposed to salvation by works. Whether it be Mormonism or Buddhism, every other religion except Christianity teaches that to reach God or heaven or Nirvana you must be a good person. You must do good things. Christianity teaches that no number of good deeds will get you into heaven, only through faith in Jesus Christ will you get into heaven. Only through putting your trust in him.\r\n\r\nThat is the entirety of the Gospel and what sets it apart from the messages of other religions.","created_utc":1136937515,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":-9,"ups":-9,"subreddit":"reddit.com"}

I'm not saying that with critical connotations, if one is going to be religious, a humble faith is important to have.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding your last statement, the basis for rejecting religion isn't because of the cool things that Jesus said. Most of the atheists I know have a moral philosophy remarkably like Jesus's, as \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is a great basis to an ethical system.  What is objectionable, however, is all the religious and social claptrap that has built up in the past 2000 years religion that leads to wars, hatred, judging one's neighbor, and affronts to human dignity such as [God Hates Fags](http://www.godhatesfags.com).  Humans of course will do these things with or without religion, but armed with the arrogance of being right (e.g. \"I know that God wants me to do\") people do much worse things than they would otherwise. (Suicide Bombers?)One might expect that religion might make also make people do more good than they would otherwise, but in my personal experience (and this is of course just anecdoctal) those who are doing the greatest good in the world--working with the poor, disadvantaged, and the downtrodden, and in the process eschewing personal wealth and comfort--are uniformly not religious.  I'm guessing your personal experience is different, that the people you know that exude fundamental decency are religious. Basically, atheists like Dawkins think that religion is holding back our society by encouraging more crime, more hate, and more bad feelings, and in general more immorality.

You or anyone but a hand full of people will never work on this project anyway.\r\n\r\nId say the problem that freenet, the most notorious example,  had with this was caused by several factors:\r\n\r\n1. Its performance was so terrible that only those doing the most elicit things bothered to stick around.\r\n2. The size of these files, usually small pictures, was optimal for freenet. There just aren't that many 200k files out there these days.\r\n3. There was a culture that celebrated the idea of being totally freed from all censorship. By human nature, this intrigued many people who then began, out of curiosity, to test the limits and see if such a thing is really possible.\r\n\r\nI2P (by itself), on the other hand, can be very poor for one to many distribution of dangerous content over a long period of time. A simple attack would be incrementally DOS or otherwise interrupt known blocks of suspected ip addresses and watching for the server in question to go offline in I2P. This will be effectively solved by layering a DHT system, perhaps freenet, on top of a mixnet like I2P.. but I digress. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I think the most advanced p2p networks have contributed very little to the spread of cp.

{"body":"That would not be the science that I am familiar with. \r\n\r\nFirstly, no _belief_ is needed to be convinced that there is no whispy dragon in the garage. We do not need belief to bridge a gap in our knowledge here - just our common-sense understanding of the world is enough. We go into that garage many times a week and never see a dragon, we know nobody has in fact ever seen one in the wild, let alone in his garage, etc. We have NO positive proof. But we do have an overwhelming amount of negative proof: it would run against all our other knowledge of the world to have a whispy dragon in the garage. Thus, I can safely and scientifically say that there is no dragon in the garage.\r\n\r\n'Ah, but there might be one NOW!', you might say. There might be, but what are the odds?

This decision will allow Nikon to continue to develop products that match the demands of an increasingly competitive market place.\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite this growing competition Nikon Corporation has continued to outperform the market, and has recently reported positive financial results which saw group net profit climb by 20% in the fiscal first half which ended in September. Group sales also increased by 9.8% to 342.85 billion yen in the same period. Sales of high end digital SLR cameras and the success of products like the D70s and D50 have helped contribute to these positive figures.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the film camera market shrinks and the popularity of compact digital cameras increases, demand for products that offer advanced features and extra value is continuing to grow. High performance digital SLR cameras are performing well as users shift from film-based SLR cameras or upgrade from compact digital cameras to digital SLR cameras.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of the new strategy Nikon will discontinue production of all lenses for large format cameras and enlarging lenses with sales of these products ceasing as soon as they run out of stock. This also applies to most of our film camera bodies, interchangeable manual focus lenses and related accessories. Although Nikon anticipates that the products will still be in retail distribution up to Summer 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recognition of Nikon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to professional photographers we will continue to manufacturer and sell the F6, our flagship film model, as well as a number of manual interchangeable lenses. Sales of the manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.\r\n","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473822873,"gilded":0,"edited":false,"id":"c4810","parent_id":"t1_c4750","author":"kn0thing","author_flair_text":null}

A lot of us were atheists (or agnostics, i.e. closeted atheists), and most of us thought we had come by our (un)beliefs by 'abandoning our preconceptions' or some such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo he said, \"Suppose that over the course of a few weeks this spring, groups of physicists working at different universities successfully prove that the universe was created by a group of superintelligent entities that the press has taken to calling 'The Big Bangers'.  Astronomical work to identify instances of their intervention in the movements of certain star clusters is proceeding rapidly, and some researchers have begun to speculate about the possibility of talking to them.  Now suppose that you've been out hiking on the Appalachian Trail for the last two months, so you learn about this all at once when you stop for gas on the drive home.  How does all this make you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story illustrates a couple of points:\r\n* \"Belief in God\" is not inherently unscientific.  It is unsupported by everything we know, but the existence of an agentive, purposeful creator of the universe hasn't been *disproven* either.\r\n* As a corollary, there are some elements of faith in atheism, but you need a pretty far-fetched example to shake that faith.\r\n* It's **not** correct to say that religion and science are about two different things (the truth-belief dichotomy), because people won't place their faith in something they know to be untrue.  Monotheists in our story would be in for an interesting ride.\r\n* It **is** correct that knowledge can be put to use in different ways, and that most people are interested in scientific knowledge in only a very cursory way.  A devout Lutheran real-estate developer in Minnesota, for example, might find ways to reconcile the polytheistic revelation with his faith (\"No God before me\" =&gt; existence of other Gods), and go on living the same way as before.  He'd be able to do this because his fundamental place in the world wouldn't have changed much.  A lapsed Hindu physicist, on the other hand, would have her professional *and* personal worlds turned upside down.  Besides the implications for physics, she might feel the need to make all kinds of changes to her life after thinking about what it all means, despite the fact that she already \"knows\", as a Hindu, that the Universe is basically ageless and is populated by many Gods   (my apologies to any Hindus out there if I've gotten this all wrong).","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_25099","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

Its atmospheric concentration is 1.7 ppmv, much less than carbon dioxide; but each molecule of methane is twenty times more effective than each molecule of carbon dioxide at trapping infrared radiation (Mackenzie and Mackenzie, 1995). Its large contribution to global warming is due in part to its potency in trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere. It is 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years. Emissions of methane have grown dramatically; methane emissions from human-related activities now represent about 70% of total emissions, as opposed to less than 10% some 200 years ago.*\r\n\r\nMethane is not minor compared to CO2.

It's about superstition being taught as science, and it's about separation of church and state.\r\n\r\nI'll preface my comment by saying that I don't necessarily think that ID should be taught in schools. However, the whole **separation of church and state** thing is so misused that its getting tiring.\r\n\r\n\"Separation of church and state\" originates from a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to a collection of Baptist ministers promising that the US government would never enact any kind of ruling that would restrict the free practice of religion in any way.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing Constitutionally or otherwise that says that Christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way. Infact, democracy implies quite the opposite: rule by the people, and if the majority of people follow one religion, it follows that governmental decisions will likely be influenced by that religion.\r\n\r\nThis is not an issue of church and state. This is an issue of science and teaching science, and I personally have yet to see really strong science that supports creationism, although I have come across many interesting things in the past few years.\r\n\r\nI personally don't think it matters. Whether evolution is true or not, I still think it is God who did the creating. I do not think that ID needs to be taught in school unless it is taught in a scientific manner. ID can be taught in the approach of, yes, there is evidence for evolution, but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of \"coincidences\" make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident.\r\n\r\nHowever, it shouldn't be a matter of popping out the Bible and saying, \"Okay, kids, this is what ID is\", because that isn't the point of school.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I dread the comments that this whole debate will get, as it is both a political and a religious issue and if it were just one of the two, the comments would be heated enough...but combine both and all hell will break loose.

{"controversiality":0,"body":"I'm sorry, I honestly have a really hard time believing either side. There has been so much that is willfully made up and lied about to support either view that I don't really know who to believe. A few years back I was reading a book about evolution and the explanation that was given as to how dinosaurs led to birds was that certain dinosaurs started jumping from tree to tree, and slowly their scales would become feathered from this. Eventually that led to the development of feathers. I'm sorry, but that is downright the most retarded thing I've ever heard in my life. No matter how much I take a lizard and feather his scales, its offspring aren't going to slowly develop feathers. That just doesn't happen. I don't know if it was just a bad explanation, but it doesn't take a biologist to realize that many explanations given for both evolution and creation are inherently flawed.\r\n\r\nI would also refer you to the [true.origin](http://www.trueorigin.org/to_deception.asp) website, which as you can guess is the other side of the coin.\r\n\r\nThere are equally intelligent people on both sides of the issue.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to provide you a few quotes from Francis Crick (we all know who he is, right? - the scientist who discovered DNA):\r\n\r\n--- pp. 51-52:\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a particular amino acid sequence was selected by chance, how rare an event would this be?\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an easy exercise in combinatorials.  Suppose the chain is about two hundred amino acids long; this is, if anything rather less than the average length of proteins of all types.  Since we have just twenty possibilities at each place, the number of possibilities is twenty multiplied by itself some two hundred times.  This is conveniently written 20200 and is approximately equal to 10260, that is, a one followed by 260 zeros.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMoreover, we have only considered a polypeptide chain of rather modest length.  Had we considered longer ones as well, the figure would have been even more immense.  The great majority of sequences can never have been synthesized at all, at any time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\np. 88:\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.  ...The plain fact is that the time available was too long, the many microenvironments on the earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface too diverse, the various chemical possibilities too numerous and our own knowledge and imagination too feeble to allow us to be able to unravel exactly how it might or might not have happened such a long time ago, especially as we have no experimental evidence from that era to check our ideas against.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ---\r\n\r\nCrick, Francis, Life Itself: Its Origin and Nature (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1981) 192 pp. \r\n\r\n&gt; \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; \"\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe I am interpreting this differently than you, but I understand that to mean that Congress will not respect the *establishment* of one particular religion (ie, the Anglican Church of England).

Yes and no.\r\n\r\nIt is convenience at low cost in terms of errors and bloating we are actually talking about.\r\n\r\nIt's true that a fairly good coder will get further quicker with Python and I like the language, but I've already run into enough run-time trouble (like accidentally truncing floats by adding them to integer variables, and having a library's incompatible string types that I needed to always cast to str() anyway), and testing will only take you only so much beyond simple bordercases. And yes, neither testing or strong typing is ideal, but I don't like not actually writing types in what is acually a typed language - imagine having to type 'int' in Python. would that destroy all its good? And what happened to the complaints about function and especially operator overloading in C++?\r\nThat said, I would probably prefer inferential typing like OCaml has. No time wasted, and never ambigious.\r\n\r\nOf course, the main point here and in various discussion as of late is 'good programmer'. Clean programmers will often treat variables as if they were statically typed anyhow just because it's more transparent and there's rarely a reason not to. A bad programmer will write spaghetti both ways. You can onyl really argue against a language's syntax when it lures even okay coders into bad code. (often details like perhaps java's exceptions, which invite you to either become extremely verbose, or catch and re-throw exceptions, the latter destroying the useful part of the stack trace, rendering exceptions half-useless)\r\n\r\nFrankly, you can say any of this for any abstraction - and, like for most of them, also that you need to know know the rules to break them.

There are public schools (government-run) and 'free' schools (mostly Catholic, a smaller percentage using alternative education systems like Steiner schools e.a.). \r\n\r\nSo all schools are subsidized, but they are not all government run. There's quite a range to choose from - from disciplinarian Catholic schools to anything-goes Steiner-like schools. \r\n\r\nNow, there still are large difference even between government-run schools. The teaching staff has a lot of choice in how to fill in the curriculum. And location makes a difference - e.g. if a kindergarten school is located in an immigrant neighbourhood, the teachers need to spend a lot of effort teaching Dutch to the children that don't speak it at home, which is kind of boring for those that do.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Actually, after reading that article a bit closer and actually viewing the 20/20 episode, I think I was wrong saying he doesn't 'get' the Belgian school system.

That doesn't mean that because the government funds research in woodland development, mining and smelting that Chomsky doesn't own the 36,000 sq.ft. home of his in a swanky Boston suburb (or the 14,000 sq.ft. vacation edition), that was built with wood, stone and metal; that the US military has bankrolled his research since he started doesn't mean he has no right to the massive salary MIT pays him.

Thus I could suggest, without explicitly stating, my *opinion* that this interview probably embodies the sort of posturing that a public intellectual with a documentary out and a book forthcoming might use to boost his exposure, and therefore not to be taken seriously.\r\n\r\n* Am I correct in assuming you think I'm faulting Dawkins for going to Church *too much* to be a credible atheist?  On the contrary, my own experience with church was similar, and I've reached conclusions that are different only in degree.  But I would never claim that twice-yearly church services in my early childhood and halfhearted attempts to read the scripture qualify me to pass judgement on the worldview of a billion other human beings.  I find it surpassingly lame that Dawkins does.\r\n\r\n* I'd be happy to prove that I am in fact an atheist.  How do you suggest I do that?\r\n\r\n* I spent my college years in Chapel Hill, North Carolina -- a very liberal university town in a very conservative state.

Think about this: schools in impovrished areas have lower test scores than areas where the wealthier/higher class live. Can you imagine how quickly good teachers would flock to those \"better\" areas, away from the kids who have lower test scores (and teachers actually get parental support)? To me, this idea is the same logic that Stossel uses.\r\n\r\nThe main point: IT IS NOT THE TEACHERS THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Yes, we all had several teachers that were idiots, but if you look at the system you need to realize that teachers are constrained by ADMIN, parents, government, the unions and other fellow teachers. Good teachers can't teach anymore because the methods that work aren't PC anymore.\r\n\r\nMy wife is a teacher and spends 75% of her time disciplining kids whose parents never taught them discipline. She has to act like a lawyer and gather enough evidence to prove the she did not \"make up\" allegations of misbehavior, otherwise the parents go nuts (my kid can never do wrong-syndrome) and she gets in big trouble (which then necessitates the union's existence to back her up, which should be ADMIN's job, but they're too scared of not being PC enough in front of the parents, who do not have to account to anyone).\r\n\r\nBlaming the teacher is just finding a scapegoat and not addressing the real issues, or at least understanding that it's a lot more complex than bad teachers or \"no child left behind.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, you can't compare a country like the US to Belgium.

Most people will stop buying Windows and Mac OS and will instead switch to free OS's provided by Google, Sun, and eventually Microsoft. \r\n\r\n&gt; 12) Intel is spending $2 billion to re-brand itself as a consumer electronics company because the future is in being cheaper, not faster. The next big consumer market will be a network computing appliance. When it hits anyone's processor can be used and Intel will be$2 billion behind.\r\n\r\nI don't know if Intel is wasting its money or not.  I believe that the next big consumer market is the handheld network computing appliance.  First, America has to discover that cellphones are for more than just talking - they're for using the Internet.\r\n\r\nHere's my prediction for 2006 (or what I think would be cool, even if it is highly unlikely):\r\n  Handheld computer makers, like blackberry, palm, handspring, and cellphone manufacturers, will FINALLY put chorded keyboards on their devices.  Kids and power users will be the first to adopt the new typing style, and everybody else will slowly catch on over several years.  Maybe in 2008 we'll see handhelds that have no buttons but are operated by touch-screens and chorded keys on the periphery of the device.\r\n\r\nSecond prediction: American cellphone companies will completely miss this innovation and will continue to offer poor cellphones with horrible software.  A Japanese cellphone company (maybe AU) will bring Japanese-quality cellphones into the US market and capture all of the young customers.","controversiality":0,"link_id":"t3_26529","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6"}

Mr. Edmundson might have 5 students in the 50 who care deeply about Friday. Maybe 10; more would require the admissions office at U.Va. to have mastered time travel. He has almost as many who've transferred in at the last minute because of schedule conflicts, and a broad middle bunch in to fulfill a requirement and get a grade. For about 80% of the class, then, Mr. Edmundson is the keeper of one of about 40 gates they must pass through to get that degree.\r\n\r\n2. Let's imagine two students, Jim Bored and Jane Engaged. Jim cares not for Freud, but he needs the credits toward his degree, which in turn he needs because he wishes to go to law school. Indifferent though he is to Freud, he does the reading, does the writing, at semester's end can give a lucid account of Thanatos, Eros, Oedipus, and the psychopathology of everyday life. Jane, heaven help her, wants to go to grad school in the humanities, and someone has suggested the class to her. She does the reading, and quickly comes to agree with Karl Kraus that psychoanalysis is a disease masquerading as a cure. She bags the class, and spends the time it would have taken in reading Kraus, on to Von Hoffmanstal, Musil, etc., etc., really engaged intellectually. Mr. Edmundson will I suppose have no option but to give her an F, unless U.Va. has provision for long-term Incompletes.\r\n\r\nSo now Jim will get his B.A., and Jane perhaps not. Whatever they know about Freud, kids who get into U.Va. understand the degree/no-degree distinction in their bones. \r\n\r\nSorry about that, Mr. Edmundson.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_26615","subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","created_utc":1137264079,"author_flair_css_class":null,"score":3,"ups":3,"author":"schmengebrother","author_flair_text":null,"parent_id":"t3_26615","edited":false,"id":"c5636","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473823499,"distinguished":null}

He observed that sisters and volunteers, some of whom had no medical knowledge, had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors in the hospice.

Is that a fault of her own?_\r\n\r\nYes. The order received hundreds of millions of dollars, but chose _not_ to use it to alleviate the suffering of the poor.\r\n\r\nMother Theresa's mission was a _religious_ one, and despite being probably the richtest religious order in the world (to the tune of probably $100 million in donations per year), despite this money being given by donors to alleviate the suffering of the poor, the poor were helped little at all, and the donors were cheated (with the money probably going to the Vatican, not to the poor).\r\n\r\nI'll just point to this translation of an article in the German magazine 'Stern':\r\n\r\nhttp://are.berkeley.edu/~atanu/Writing/teresa.html\r\n\r\n_All this points to one thing, something that Mother Teresa reiterated very frequently in her speeches and addresses -- that she far more concerened with life after death than the mortal life._\r\n\r\n_Mother Teresa's business was : Money for a good conscience. The donors benefitted the most from this. The poor hardly. Whosoever believed that Mother Teresa wanted to cahnge the world, eliminate suffering or fight poverty, simply wanted to believe it for their own sakes. Such people did not listen to her. To be poor, to suffer was a goal, almost an ambition or an achievement for her and she imposed this goal upon those under her wings; her actual ordained goal was the hereafter._\r\n\r\n_With growing fame, the founder of the order became somewhat conscious of the misconceptioons on which the Mother Teresa phenomenon was based. She wrote a few words and hung them outside Mother House:_\r\n\r\n_\"Tell them we are not here for work, we are here for Jesus. We are religious above all else.

I acknowledge that in the name of religion, countless good works have been done, but also, countless intolerances have been promoted.

Her actions (or inaction) are logical seen from her belief in the afterlife. From a non-believer's point of view, her order has squandered a great opportunity to help the weak and alleviate the pain of the suffering, and has sucked up a great deal of money that was intended to be used in such a way.\r\n\r\n_People who take such actions and give up their lives for others aren't \"throwing away\" their lives...they are using it for anothers' benefit.

Mother Theresa's driving force was her belief, which led her not to take the actions that a humanistic western world would have expected her to take, but led her to care more for the souls than for the bodies of those in her care. In the logic of the true believer, it is more important to save a soul from eternal damnation than it is to cure their tuberculosis - in fact a bit of suffering is good for the soul. Baptising is more important than sterilizing needles. That is the inescapable logic if you truly believe in the afterlife. This was the belief of Mother Theresa. And the Catholic church agrees, since Mother Theresa is well on her way to sainthood (she has already been beatified).\r\n\r\nSince I am not a great believer in the existence of the eternal soul, I find this devaluation of life morally repugnant.","link_id":"t3_26831","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1137278658,"score":8,"ups":8,"author":"Luc","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c5704","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c5694","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473823516,"distinguished":null}

The number of points is given by the following equation:\r\n\r\nPoints = (# credit hours) x (grade points)\r\n\r\nWhere the credit hours roughly corresponds to the number of hours that the class meets per week.  In American universities and colleges, students can expect that for every hour spent in the classroom, 2-3 hours will be necessary outside the classroom for homework and studying.  In one semester, the typical student takes 3-5 classes, for a total of about 15 credit hours.  A 12 credit hour schedule is considered 'full-time' and earns eligibility for financial aid.\r\n\r\nGrade points are assigned by a grading scale.  The most common scale is the 4.0 scale, where A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.  Most schools do not use 'E'.  Anything below a 'D' is considered failing, and receives 'F'.\r\n\r\nMy Software Engineering class meets three times a week, MWF, from 12 to 12:50.  This is 2.5 hours of actual time in class, but the class is for 3 credit hours.  If I receive an 'A' in the class, I will get 3x4 = 12 points.\r\n\r\nThe Grade Point Average is calculated from all classes for which the student has received grade points:\r\n\r\nGPA = SUM(grade points) / SUM(credit hours)\r\n\r\nThe semester GPA includes classes taken in a particular semester.  The 'cumulative' GPA includes all classes that the student has taken in university.\r\n\r\nA student must earn only 'A's to get a 4.0 GPA.  A student who receives an equal number of 'A's as 'B's will have a GPA around 3.50.  Each grade's contribution to the GPA is weighted by the class's number of credit hours.  This means that a 4 hour class has more affect on your GPA than a 3 hour class.\r\n\r\nLet's take a hypothetical student, called Joe.  Joe has just begun his third year in university (he's a Junior).  He has already taken 56 credit hours of classes, for which he has earned 191 grade points.\r\n\r\nJoe's current cumulative GPA = 191 / 56 = 3.41\r\n\r\nThis indicates that Joe receives roughly equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's.  Or for every 'C' that Joe receives, he earns three 'A's to make up for it.  Now let's look at Joe's schedule for this semester:\r\n\r\n3 credits Software Design\r\n\r\n3 credits Linear Algebra\r\n\r\n3 credits Intermediate Japanese I\r\n\r\n4 credits Physics II\r\n\r\n3 credits Introduction to Sociology\r\n--\r\n16 credits total\r\n\r\nLet's pretend that it is the end of the semester and Joe is expecting to receive an 'A' in Linear Algebra, a 'B' in Software Design, and an 'A' in Japanese.  His grades for Physics and Sociology are hovering between 'A's and 'B's.  These two classes have pending assignments that will swing the grades to 'A' or to 'B'.  Joe is a pretty good student but he didn't manage his time very well and now doesn't have enough time to do an excellent job on both assignments.  Should Joe choose to earn an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology, or vice versa?  The merits of the two subjects aside, let's look at the effect on his GPA.  An 'A' in Physics will earn 16 grade points while an 'A' in Sociology would earn 12.  A 'B' in Physics earns 12 grade points, while a 'B' in Sociology earns 9.  He's anticipating these grade points:\r\n\r\n191 points (previously earned)\r\n\r\n9 points for a 'B' in Software Design (3 hr)\r\n\r\n12 points for an 'A' in Linear Algebra (3 hr)\r\n\r\n12 points for an 'A' in Intermediate Japanese I (3 hr)\r\n\r\n16 or 12 points for Physics II (4 hr)\r\n\r\n12 or 9 points for Introduction to Sociology (3 hr)\r\n\r\nWhen the semester is finished, he will have 56+16=72 hours of earned credit.  If he gets an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology then he will earn 58 grade points.  If he goes for an 'B' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology then he will get 57 grade points.  How will this affect his cumulative GPA?\r\n\r\nCumulative GPA = (191+58)/72 = 249/72 = 3.458 = 3.46\r\n\r\nCumulative GPA = (191+57)/72 = 248/72 = 3.444 = 3.44\r\n\r\nJoe perceives himself to be in the interval between 3.0 and 4.0, so the choice appears to have a bearing of 2% on his cumulative GPA!  This is flawed reasoning that snares many students.  Joe must remember that he will have earned about 130 credit hours when he graduates.  If his GPA is 3.5 then he will have 455 grade points.  His choice between an 'A' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology accounts for only 1/455 or 0.2% of his final GPA.\r\n\r\nThe typical engineering student spends at least 3 years thinking about his GPA.  Students who begin thinking about their GPA after their first year of study will probably graduate in 4 years.  Engineering students who take 2 years to realize their academic peril usually require 5 years to graduate.\r\n\r\nThe GPA is our slave master.  Students with more than 3.5 feel that every grade less than an 'A' is a black mark on their transcript because it brings their GPA down.  They work so hard for their grades and give up social activities to spend more time studying.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the comfortable region is between 3.1 and 3.5.  Students in this region are earning 'A's and 'B's and can afford to get a 'C' in a class that is very boring.  These students may be just as smart as the &gt;3.5 students, but they make different choices.  Some of them would be &gt;3.5 but they have to work and don't have much time to study.\r\n\r\nThe biggest injustice of the GPA system is that everyone looks at the cumulative GPA, which represents the student's entire undergraduate career.  Students who have difficulty adjusting to life at university often earn poor grades in their first and second years.  These poor grades mar the GPA and make significant improvement impossible.  Even if a student consistently earns 3.75 in each subsequent semester, the cumulative GPA can remain very low.  Most graduate school programs have minimum cumulative GPA requirements.  Many employers look only at the cumulative GPA when evaluating a new graduate's academic performance.  The knowledge of this can evince an enormous amount of stress for the struggling first or second year student.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, schools should calculate a 2-year GPA rather than a cumulative GPA.  At least, employers and graduate schools should request the semester GPAs for the final 4 semesters of a student's undergraduate studies.  These scores will show any improvement in the student's performance that may be hidden in a cumulative GPA.","link_id":"t3_26775","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1137295936,"ups":7,"score":7}

You really thing the solution is to kick people out of college? I keep running into this elitism thats starting to bug me.\"\r\n\r\nActually, I think he's dead-on. He's not talking about \"kicking people out\" of college, and it's not elitism. The only reason it *seems* like elitism is because our culture has an irrational obsession with college education. A university degree used to be a special thing that only a certain percentage of people -- a certain number of professions -- really had any need for. Now it is seen as the bare minimum requirement for anything other than a minimum-wage service job. And the sad truth is that, in many cases, a person's degree has little or nothing to do with the profession they end up in; and even if it does, the reality of that profession is often wildly different from what they learned in school. Result: they (or, more likely, their parents) blew tens of thousands of dollars for a piece of paper in order to gain entry to a job that they would have been no less qualified for without a day of college.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to kick people out of college (unless they're failing, of course), but we -- as parents, employers, companies, and a society -- do need to stop indoctrinating our children with the notion that college is the One True Path for Success. There are plenty of people who need a higher education for what they want to do with their lives, and plenty of people who can benefit from it in general. There are also plenty of people who have no need for it, or at least don't need to jump into it right out of high school. We are drastically misusing our universities, and the results are not the least bit surprising."}

{"controversiality":0,"body":"The slashdotter's appreciation of the difference in value systems is right on, though his subtle suggestion of rational discourse between the differing sides is not. It's too late. Globalization has pervaded a society that has largely stagnated in economic, social, and governmental evolution (or GROWTH if the term 'evolution' strikes you as too politically incorrect). The consumer goods of the west or their knockoffs have shown up en masse, and satellite dishes with hot chips hang from the balconies of level after level of government built ghettos. They've seen what they don't have, there aren't many promising jobs or even a distant hope of one, and they have religious leaders antagonizing them further by insisting that what intrigues them is the work of the devil. It was nearly enough to make one miss the Christian fundamentalists, but not quite.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, there was a wounded pride that was shared regardless of religious sect or ethnic difference, which is really something, since you could construct a complex flow chart of who hates who just going by those factors. The Shiites hate the Sunnis, the Sunnis hate the Shiites, and the Kurds see them both as dogs. They all support the Palestinians against the Israelis (anti-semitism might be the one unifying factor I stumbled  across...or anti-Jew might be more apt, 'cause aren't most of the region technically Semitic?), which was ironic, since all of them looked at the Palestinians with a shameful disdain.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part was how many of them were disgusted with the the religious leaders that scare the west, though  this was voiced in very quite tones indicative of how they scare the locals too. I should dislose that my amateur anthropology was largely confined to college educated english speakers (in most of the area universities, particularly the technical ones, you learn english or you flunk out, since the the courses are taught in english, and the textbooks are western). They were also mostly practicing Muslims, though they reminded me of American Catholics, picking and choosing what aspects of the doctrine they would observe.\r\n\r\nI came away from my little foray realizing just how screwed we were. The conflict between the west and the middle east, or near east, or central asia, or whatever the hell you want to label it has so many different converging factors and long building momentum that it seems inevitable. It also seems as if it shouldn't be a suprise. It also appears logical that other parts of the world (particularly Africa) will be following suit in some way as soon as it crawls out of unbelievably destitute poverty to just ridiculously destitute poverty. Envy, religion, oppression, poverty all play a roll. I don't think anyone has a clue as to how to solve it, but I'm sure that any alleviation is a lot more complex than just the application of hard power. I didn't support the justification for Iraq, and war sucks, but damn I hope it works out. \r\n\r\n","subreddit_id":"t5_6","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_27151","subreddit":"reddit.com","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1137398301,"author_flair_css_class":null,"author":"bigheadarmy","author_flair_text":null,"id":"c6013","parent_id":"t1_c5939","edited":false,"gilded":0,"distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824058}

The biggest smoking gun I've seen (among many): In the very pro-official-story PBS documentary on the subject, Larry Silverstein, the lease-holder of the whole complex at the time (who took on the lease a year earlier in what an outsider would have called a very bad deal), says that, on 9/11, after building 7 had been burning for a while, they \"MADE THE DECISION TO PULL IT\".  As you can verify for yourself, 'pull' is a construction term for controlled demolition.  Officially the building lost structural integretity (and neatly collapsed into its own footprint at freefall speed).  This is important because there is no earthly way that charges could have been set up to demolish building seven on that day.  It would have taken a week with a non-burning building.  I am not a 'nut'; I am a rational human being.  Any other rational person, who isn't too frightened to examine the evidence closely, will come to the same conclusion.  The official story is not just inaccurate; it is a deliberate lie.\r\n\r\nEdit: Motive:\r\nhttp://reddit.com/goto?id=27809"}

It is not true that Orwell had a lifetime of believing in socialism. He had been an anarchist previously but rejected it quite easily on the grounds that if crime was profitable, you would either need a strongly enforced criminal justice system or live under gangster rule.

{"controversiality":0,"body":"A clarification: sometimes you hear this argument phrased as if \"the ecomomy\" will magically cause more oil to appear after present supplies are gone, and that's misleading.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, there's a lot of oil left in the ground that oil drillers never collect because oil drilling is usually only 30% to 70% efficient.  That figure is driven more by the world demand for oil than by limitations in extraction technology.  So as the oil price rises, it's cost-effective to recover more and more oil from existing wells.  This is one reason (taxes are another) why gas prices in the US are much lower than in Europe -- at ~ $35/bbl, lots of oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, &amp; Louisiana \"turn on\".  \r\n\r\n**Some people** take this argument further and say there's nothing to worry about at all, because a world oil price stays above $50/bbl for a few years would make it economical to start going after tar sands in Canada and oil shale deposits in the Rocky Mountains, although the technologies necessary to do this have never been demonstrated at scale.","link_id":"t3_27358","stickied":false,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","subreddit":"reddit.com","author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1137429102,"score":4,"ups":4,"author":"mnemonicsloth","author_flair_text":null,"edited":false,"id":"c6120","parent_id":"t1_c6102","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473824077,"distinguished":null}

The official story is not just inaccurate; it is a deliberate lie.\r\n\r\nI think this is the biggest problem with conspiracy theory. As soon as a theory is denounced as being ludicrous, or irrational, the conspiracy theorists jump back and claim that they know the one true reality and that everything else is a lie. (kind of reminiscent of the intelligent design debate) The conspiracy theorists and the rationalists each find the other's views to be incoprehensible. \r\n\r\nIf anything, researching conspiracy theory has taught me the fallacies of holding on to any one, objective reality, as being an absolute truth. A while ago I went, in a few days, from believing conspiracy theories were absurd, to being afraid that one of David Icke's reptoids was going to eat me, or something like that. I still think Icke's theories are brilliant, in the way they incorporate so many other theories and religions into one grand conspiracy, but I think of it more as a novel now than as an absolute truth.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of immediately denouncing any conspiracy theory, or anti-conspiracy-theory as being unobjective and a lie (especially for the 9/11 theories, of which I seem to change my mind every few days), we could simply cite the evidence, and look at it from a real objective, distanced viewpoint.","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_27340","stickied":false,"subreddit":"reddit.com","score":2,"ups":2,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1137434271}

I brought up the chicken/egg problem with building the necessary infrastructure because you seemed to think central planning will likely be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut onto how \"incredibly simple\" a charging station at every gas station would be: My 2liter 4-cylinder non-turbo car engine is 130Kw, to put that into perspective a heater (on full) draws about 2Kw and over a year a home averages about 0.5Kw. When I floor it, I am consuming enough power to run 260 houses, this is a small car, especially by American standards.\r\n\r\nNow granted, the car is only 130Kw when I floor it, but at a gas station I don't want to wait 3 days for the car to be charged enough to run 7 days. Petrol contains 8.9Kwh/liter, so assuming I want to only wait 10 minutes for the equivalent of a 40 liter tank (10 gallons of gas), that's a 2.1 megawatt source of power the petrol station requires, alongside 2.1 megawatt cabling.\r\n\r\nBut I don't want to wait an hour for the 6 cars ahead of me to charge, the petrol station should have at least 5 pumps, meaning a 10 megawatt power feed.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we have to install this infrastructure in every gas station (or perhaps every 10th station to begin with), and then somehow get that kind of power to them - every gas station in the country is now consuming the equivalent of 7,000 homes (21,000 homes if demand is round the clock).\r\n\r\nNow I hear America already has trouble producing enough electricity.\r\n\r\nThere are also more subtle problems, peak oil will cause a permanent oil shock, the spike (which isn't really a spike, because it won't be coming down) will likely force the economy into recession and with oil initially costing nearly 10 times what it does today (a figure lots of people seem to bandy around, but perhaps it wont be that bad), building new infrastructure becomes prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nSo really, we need to be laying out the alternative fuel infrastructure _now_ while we still have some cheap oil to build it with.\r\n\r\n(And I say \"now\" because when America has to dip into the strategic reserve in order to avoid oil shocks because _global_ production can't manage anymore when a few oil rigs in the gulf coast go offline from a hurricane - you know peak oil is right around the corner)","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824100,"gilded":0,"id":"c6295","edited":false,"parent_id":"t1_c6233","author_flair_text":null,"author":"TheCookieMonster"}

In the past, whenever we have grown the economy we have just pumped a little more oil each day to supply it. Peek oil is when we've reached the fastest that we can pump oil, and any economy that wants to grow has to either find another source of cheap energy, or take oil out of someone else's economy. To make matters worse, after peek oil the speed at which we can pump it will start to decline, furthering the gap between supply and demand.\r\n\r\nImagine 50 people in the desert find a tap of water, eventually they figure out the flow is only enough water to keep 47 of them alive - so if they split it evenly they'd all eventually die of thirst. There's plenty of water coming out of the tap (it certainly hasn't run out), just not enough for 50 people. So rather than split it evenly and all die they decide to apply a market model to it. The water was dirt cheap when there was enough (like oil is now), but once there isn't enough (and it's only a tiny fraction not enough), nobody wants to be one of the 3 people that will die, and so they all bid everything they can spare for something that used to cost so little, yet the water isn't anywhere near running out.","score":1,"ups":1,"created_utc":1137493217,"author_flair_css_class":null,"subreddit":"reddit.com","edited":false,"id":"c6299","parent_id":"t1_c6233","author_flair_text":null,"author":"TheCookieMonster","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824100,"gilded":0}

Even the separation into Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) doesn't do justice to the variety of spoken Chinese throughout China. \r\nWhereas Mandarin is the official language of China, based largely on the local language in Beijing, the capitol, Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the Chinese diaspora, due to the importance of the South-east of China in international trade. That said, there are many different local variants of Chinese, which when spoken are mutually unintelligible. Useful comparisons to the structure of the Chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan, etc.) to Latin. [All of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility] Another is the case of Arabic, where there are many varieties of spoken Arabic (Iraqi, Morrocan, Egyptian, Syrian, etc.) and literary Arabic, which is common throughout, based on the qur'anic version of Arabic. \r\n\r\nThat said, Chinese, like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak. It is, nonetheless, a difficult writing system to master, even for chinese-born native speakers. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824810686] \r\nFor adult foreigners, however, it poses a bit more of a challenge. \r\nThe article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome. \r\nI generally agree, however, there are a number of phonemes ( sounds) which simply do not occur in English (insert your local language here), which to occur in Chinese. These pose a challenge as well. \r\nTonality is either a huge problem (my father is tone-deaf;I don't believe he could ever become fluent in Chinese) or just takes a lot of discipline/practice (remembering the mapping between sound/tone combinations and meaning; Fortunately context, aids in this process)\r\nThe writing system is not so bad, though it requires *a lot* of practice to maintain one's skill. To my surprise, I find it is more similar to Western writing systems, than I ever would have suspected. (In the process of this discovery, I feel I have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language)\r\nFinally, I find the comment by Dr. Weightman on Grammar at the end particularly misleading. Chinese grammar seems transparent to English speakers, particularly those who have studied a language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words, to modify tense, declension, etc. (read: Finnish) This is due to the lack of inflection in Chinese - that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning.\r\n\r\nI am not too far along in my study of Chinese language, but I find the difficulty is often over-sold. (except to the tone-deaf, who should never try to learn tonal languages) That's not to say that it is a piece of cake. There are some mental hurdles - tonality, bizzare sounds, a different writing paradigm, and an unfamiliar approach to grammar. Once those are managable at a basic level, I find that dilligence and practice are all that are required.\r\n\r\nPS IANALing (I am not a linguist)","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824134,"gilded":0,"id":"c6416","edited":false,"parent_id":"t3_27687","author":"isaacharley","author_flair_text":null}

Some examples:\r\n\r\n\"Early in the 20th century, the U.S. economy began to dominate the world economy. \"\r\n\r\nWell, the US became a major economic player early in the 20th century.  But it wasn't until after WWII that it began to \"dominate\" the world economy.\r\n\r\n\"The Great Depression, with its preceding inflation from 1921 to 1929...\"\r\n\r\nInflation was extremely low during that period, with several years of outright deflation.  See: http://eh.net/hmit/compare/result.php?use%5B%5D=DOLLAR&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPDEFLATION&amp;use%5B%5D=UNSKILLED&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=NOMINALGDP&amp;amount2=1&amp;year2=&amp;year_result=1929&amp;amount=1&amp;year_source=1921 and http://inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Rate/HistoricalInflation.aspx?dsInflation_currentPage=6\r\n\r\n\"It did not enforce the direct payment of taxes like all of its predecessor empires did, but distributed instead its own fiat currency, the U.S. Dollar, to other nations in exchange for goods\"\r\n\r\nThat's not typically how it works.  The US exchanges it's own fiat (actually fiat+fiduciary) dollar to other nations in exchange for their currency (typically, also fiat+fiduciary), which is then exchanged for foriegn goods (and vice versa).\r\n\r\n\"The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent U.S. trade deficits..\"\r\n\r\nYeah, that happened.  In the 1980s.  What's this doing in a paragraph talking about Lyndon Johnson?\r\n\r\n\"When in 1970-1971 foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold, The U.S. Government defaulted on its payment on August 15, 1971. While the popular spin told the story of \u00e2\u0080\u009csevering the link between the dollar and gold\u00e2\u0080\u009d, in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government. Essentially, the U.S. declared itself an Empire. It had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world, with no intention or ability to return those goods...\"\r\n\r\nThis is exactly backwards.  The US ran significant trade *surpluses* during that period.  In other words, the world extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the US - in exchange for promises to pay us back with their goods and services later, at interest (aka - debt).  Inflating the currency at that point would have no effect on debts denominated in other currencies, and would actually reduce the return to american holders of foreign debt denominated in dollars.\r\n\r\nToo tired to go on.  Here's a hint about economics - if someone starts talking about gold, they're most likely a nut.","controversiality":0,"score":8,"ups":8,"author_flair_css_class":null,"created_utc":1137534166,"subreddit":"reddit.com","id":"c6543","parent_id":"t3_27809","edited":false,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"bonecrusher","distinguished":null,"retrieved_on":1473824154,"gilded":0}

Or not.  As someone once wrote, \"grace beats karma.\"\r\n","controversiality":0,"subreddit_id":"t5_6","link_id":"t3_28041","stickied":false}

There is little (or none at all?) syntax; even assignment (=, :=) is a method.  It has even deeper reflection capabilities than Ruby.  You can access the AST in Io (and I've had need to do that in Ruby, but you have to resort to ripper or ParseTree which are a bit hackish), multiple VMs can run in the same application, and the actor-based concurrency model sounds interesting.  Oh, and Io apparently has macros.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, Ruby is my favorite programming language so far, so I'm in no way dissing Ruby.  It's just time to learn a new language and Io looks like it has a very nice feature set."}
