It concisely sums up how the economic world works in a way anyone could understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for one side argument.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me the article claims that for an economy to be successful it must let their wealth generators keep what they make.  That without this component the talented will have no incentive to create.\r\n\r\nThat may be the reason capitalism has been so successful, but are we sure our economy isn't just a local maximum?\r\n\r\nIs there really no other reason to create wealth?\r\n\r\nYou argue that without this incentive everyone's output will be reduced to the mean as it is in a big bureaucratic business.\r\n\r\nBut you also state that no-one really like working this slow and that an engineer would work their ass off on sexy projects like fighter jets.  Open source is another example that shows there has to be more incentives to a person than just building wealth.\r\n\r\nMaybe big business can't get as much out of their troops because the only incentive they can give is money.  What if they no longer needed to provide this.  What if they were forced to find something else to give their employees.  Would they be able to motivate people better than they do now?\r\n\r\nGoogle has many top producers that no longer need personal wealth and yet they still seem to be innovating.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaybe capitalism works so well because it's easy.  Letting people keep what they create takes relatively little infrastructure.\r\n\r\nBut, as the economy grows it seems to be getting harder.  We need more laws, more financial institutions, more cruft.  More wasted wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding the infrastructure of a central economy without corruption is a hard, risky problem.  But maybe at some point it will be cheaper than what we have now.","stickied":false,"link_id":"t3_20775","subreddit_id":"t5_6","gilded":0,"retrieved_on":1473820905,"distinguished":null,"author_flair_text":null,"author":"GiM","edited":false,"id":"c1820","parent_id":"t3_20775"}

I noticed that change from \"What we did and did right\" to \"what we're doing\". I don't even blog, so maybe a little unfair to post what I did - however it was an observation from my own that I used to enthuse about your essays.
